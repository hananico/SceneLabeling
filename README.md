# SceneLabeling


Please node first one needs to generate features for each segments, then by using classifiers, in our case RF find confidences for those segments.
Afterwards, using Graphical lasso ( the codes are in the folder) the graph structure can be found and the optimization is done by graph cut or similar methods.

FindStructureFromData_param is the main function to label test images.

M is the matrix you can find based on probabilities or features. â€¨The trained tree model using Random forest should be trained first, any other classifier that can proceed the probability or scores for super-pixel features can be used.
smoothcovsel_solver and GraphicalLasso are packages used for finding correlations between variables.
get connectivity is supposed to find which super pixels are connected based on the position of their centers.
